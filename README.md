# Demo of Pytorch-Lightning

[Pytorch-lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a framework for organizing ML code and abstracting away boilerplate patterns. It makes code more readable, easier to reproduce, and to a large extent decouples ML research from ML engineering.

This repo contains a Pytorch Lightning demo in the file [lightning-template](lightning-template.ipynb). In the notebook, we download MNIST data, build a model, train the model, visualize the training, and demonstrate how pytorch-lightning simplifies the whole process.
